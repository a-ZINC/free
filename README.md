# WhatsApp Receipt Processing - Enhancement Notes

## Problem Solved

* Users didn't know what details were missing when receipts failed validation
* Previous system only showed "matched" or "not matched" without context

## Key Improvements

### 1. ✅ **Matched** - Receipt linked successfully

### 2. 📎 **Matched with Missing Details** - Linked but needs action
